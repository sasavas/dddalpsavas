This is not by any means a final project. It is a work in progress, and I did not have time to develop it to the point to casually use it.

## TODOs
 
- [ ] Add sample Background jobs
- [ ] Set up Fluent API for endpoint requests validation mechanism


## About Template

update the template based on the .template.config/template.json configuration

```shell 
dotnet new --install . --force
```

use it like following

```shell
dotnet new dddalpsavas -n YourBrandNewAppName
```

## Starting

search for //TODO s and rename app-specific stuff.


## Database

Uses Postgres.


## Other

Put third party libraries & implementations in the lib folder.
